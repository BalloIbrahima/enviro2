=What exactly does BlogVault backup?=
BlogVault Backup Service backs up everything in your WordPress site incrementally and completely – Including posts, pages, files, themes, images, etc. A WordPress site consists of 2 parts:
* Database backup – We back up the complete database.
* Files backup – We back up all the files within your core WordPress folders (wp-content, wp-includes, and wp-admin).

This strategy ensures that we do not miss anything on your site.

=How often does BlogVault backup my WordPress site?=
BlogVault backs up your website daily, automatically.

=How safe are my backup files?=
Your backups are very safe. We use encrypted cloud backups and off-site BlogVault servers to store your site backups and run security operations. This ensures seamless integration of security to your website without affecting your site servers.

=Can I have all backups sync to my Google Drive and not Dropbox?=
We do not automatically sync your backups to Dropbox. However, we do provide an interface that can help enable you to move your backup to Dropbox. You can also download your Backups to your computer and then upload them on Google Drive.

=Can BlogVault be used for WooCommerce store websites?=
Yes, BlogVault integrates well with WooCommerce websites with the special inbuilt Real-Time backups functionality. Please see **[WooCommerce backups page](http://bit.ly/2RKNfrR)**.

=What does BlogVault backup from a WooCommerce site?=
BlogVault backups files and tables, database metadata like database name, location, all content, settings, and configuration.

=Can I restore WooCommerce store backup using BlogVault?=
Yes. Restoring a backup using BlogVault is easy. Take a look at **[how to restore a site](http://bit.ly/2RL9gXN)**.

=Can I use BlogVault to handle Backup Restoration?=
Yes, BlogVault’s Auto recovery functionality gets your site back up and running with almost Zero Downtime. Please see **[Auto-Recovery page](http://bit.ly/2RKsEUE)**.

=What is the difference between Restore and Test Restore?=
Test Restore is meant to test the backups only, whereas Restore helps to restore a backup on the live site, directly.

=Can I restore a backup to a new server?=
Yes. You can do this by making use of our integrated Migration feature where you can choose the backup version that you want to migrate to a new server or new site.

=Where is the staging site located?=
Your staging site will be on BlogVault servers.

=How long is my staging valid?=
With the BlogVault backup service, you can extend your staging site validity up to 56 days.

=What do I do after Staging a site?=
After you are satisfied with your staging site, BlogVault Backup Service allows you can push the changes you like, onto your actual live site, directly.

=Will I receive emails from the staging environment?=
No, we do not have a mailing system at the Staging server. Many sites have automated emails set up on their sites. On staging environments, they do not want these to be triggered. The staging environment does not have protection for spam emails. Blocking all emails ensures that the staging server IP is not blacklisted.

=Can I merge the WooCommerce website staging site to the live site?=
If you move them from the staging site to the live site, all your new orders will be lost on the live site. But we have provided you with the option with the selective merge. Select only the tables you want to merge and let BlogVault take care of the rest for you. Please don’t forget to backup your website before you start merging.

=Does BlogVault backup work with all web hosts?=
Yes. We’ve built BlogVault to work with any web host in the world. You just need to provide FTP credentials for the destination server. We migrate your WordPress site, whether you are:

Migrating to or from GoDaddy, BlueHost, SiteGround, HostGator, WPEngine, Flywheel, etc. OR Migrating to any other web host (in this case you’ll have to select either the cPanel or FTP options).

=Will there be downtime during migration?=
No, BlogVault Backup Service will cause no downtime to the destination server while migration.

=Will BlogVault start backing up the new site after migration?=
Unless otherwise specified, BlogVault will backup a site following DNS resolution. If you migrated the site to a different URL, make sure the new URL is added as a site with BlogVault to enable backup. If the migration were to the same URL at a different host, BlogVault would automatically start doing a backup from the new location as soon as the DNS is updated.

=Can I update WordPress core, plugins, and themes directly?=
Yes. Take a look at this **[Manage Site help doc](http://bit.ly/2ROA9du)**. Before updating on the live site, we’d suggest you update on a staging site. BlogVault Backup Service comes with a free staging website.

=Can I manage my site users and their password directly?=
Yes. With the BlogVault backup service, you can manage your site users and passwords. Take the help of this **[Manage Site help doc](http://bit.ly/2ROA9du)**.

=Can I add Clients and Team Members to my BlogVault Backup account?=
Yes, you can.

Our client feature is for your reference alone. You can assign a client to their site. If you want to give a user, dashboard access, please add them as your team members under the team section. Please see **[How do I add clients and team members](http://bit.ly/2RK7p5t)**?

=Isn’t WordPress or Web Host backing up my website for me?=
WordPress by default does not back up your site for you. As for web hosts, if your site is not on wordpress.com, then you have a reason to worry. Servers, while generally robust, do fail from time to time for various reasons. Moreover, web hosting providers usually do not provide complete backups. When such backups are restored, sites crash, and data is lost. Several such horror stories inspired us to build this service!

=Do I really need BlogVault?=
BlogVault provides comprehensive and complete backup services. Apart from handling website security, it can also assist you with instant Migration as well as Staging and Merging services at very reasonable rates.
This is a backup and security service that remains committed to your website security by handling site management functions. If you care about keeping your WordPress website safe, then you definitely need a security solution like BlogVault.

=What will the security report contain?=
Your Website Reports will contain details on the following:
* WP Version
* Total Backups made
* Backups Time range
* Total security scans made (Backup+Security plan only)
* Active Theme
* Number of Published Posts
* Number of Published Pages
* Number of Approved Comments
* Total database tables
* Total Files
* Total Plugins
* Active Plugins
* Installed Themes

=Is BlogVault compatible with all other WordPress plugins and themes?=
BlogVault is compatible with all plugins and themes. It works even if you have a different backup plugin installed. If you want to uninstall a plugin and install the BlogVault plugin, kindly take a look at our guide on **[How to install BlogVault](http://bit.ly/2RKgPxP)**.

=Error: "FTP permission issues, FTP is correct but we might not have permissions to upload or remove a file."=
This could happen when you’re on shared hosting. Contact your host and ask them to grant you access to upload files via FTP.

=Error: "Execution expired, Connection timed out, Connection reset by a peer in both FTP and HTTP requests."=
Nothing to worry about, this notification means your destination server denied our requests to offload your site’s data. This could be because of a few reasons:
* Your destination site isn’t reachable (you’ll have to contact your destination web host about this)
* You have a firewall installed, which is blocking consecutive requests from the same source (in which case, please wait for some time and try again)

=How can I submit a feature request?=
We are happy to accept all feature requests for our products and services. Simply fill in a detailed description of our **[contact form](https://blogvault.net/contact/)**, and we’ll make sure the correct department reviews the request. We cannot guarantee that all requests will be satisfied, but we love hearing feedback from our users.
